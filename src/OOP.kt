    // 11.3) Inheritance
    //Read more here: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/inheritance.html
    //All classes in Kotlin have a common superclass,
    // Any, which is the default superclass for a class with no supertypes declared:

    val student = Student("Bob", 101)
    student.display()
    student.completeAssignments()
    student.introduction()

    println(student is Person)//true

    // 11.4) Abstract class and Interface
    //abstract class
    // ProgrammingLanguage("Java") gives error, as we can't directly instantiate it and makes no sense
    Java().printStatement()
    Kotlin().printStatement()

    //interface
    //Read more here: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/interfaces.html
    //Mobile and Laptop are different and unrelated classes but
    //both can play music because they implement interface
    Mobile().play()
    Laptop().play()

    //Z implements multiple interfaces
    Z().bar()

    // 11.5) anonymous class in kotlin

    //repeatedly creating classes just to extend some other
    //class can be cumbersome hence we can use an anonymous class to achieve the same
    //for eg. to extend the Person class from the previous example

    val student2 = object : Person("John") {
        override fun introduction() {
            super.introduction()
            println("My name is John and I am a student")
        }
    }

    //so we can see we have absolutely simplified our code!
    student2.introduction()

    //Read more about object and anonymous classes here:
    //https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html

    //11.6) companion objects
    //similar to Java static methods but they are not actually static methods
    //but we can use them that way
    //calling this code from Java will treat it as a static object
    MyClass.someMethod()

    //Read more about it here:
    //https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html

    //11.7) SAM/Functional Interfaces

    //An interface with only one abstract method is called a functional interface,
    // or a Single Abstract Method (SAM) interface

    //in the previous section we saw how we can use object to
    //to simply extension of classes
    //now we can make our code even more concise if its a SAM
    //eg.

    val message = Messenger { println("Recd. msg: $it") }
    message.message("Hello!")
    //longer version
//    val message = object : Messenger {
//        override fun message(msg: String) {

//        }

    //11.8) Nested and Inner classes

    //Read more here:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/nested-classes.html
    //eg.
    Outer.Nested().foo()

    //a nested class can be marked as inner if we want to access
    //outside class members
    OuterClass().Inner().foo()

    //11.9) data classes
    //Read more at:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html
    //Read this too:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/equality.html
    //good answers: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51340603/what-is-difference-between-and-in-kotlin

    //if we want a class just to hold data
    //for eg. lets say we have a list of users for a website
    //and we use instance of a class User which holds
    //data for each and every user
    //then we can use data classes instead of writing boilerplate

    val user1 = User("John", 19)
    val user2 = User("Bob", 21)
    println(user1)
    println(user2)

    //destructuring
    val (name, age) = user1

    val user3 = user1.copy(name = "Ralph")
    val user4 = user2.copy()
    println(user3)

    //this is possible because of data classes!
    println(user2 == user4)

    //11.10) extension functions
    //Read more at:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html#extension-functions
    //Kotlin provides the ability to extend a class or an interface with new
    // functionality without having to inherit from the class

    //For example, you can write new functions for a class or an interface from a third-party
    // library that you can't modify. Such functions can be called in the usual way,
    // as if they were methods of the original class.
    // This mechanism is called an extension function.

    //eg.
    val list = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
    println(list)
    //magic of extension functions!
    list.swap(0, 2)
    println(list)

    //11.11) Generics
    //Read more: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/generics.html
    val boxInt: Box<Int> = Box(1)
    val boxStr: Box<String> = Box("Hello")

fun MutableList<Int>.swap(index1: Int, index2: Int) {
    val tmp = this[index1] // 'this' corresponds to the list
    this[index1] = this[index2]
    this[index2] = tmp
}

lass Person(val name: String) {
    fun sayHello() {
